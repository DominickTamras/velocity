    "... And back to the current news. Trouble over on Earth, where the U.N, have
    determined the planet has now entered category six in the current resource depletion.
    Many natural resources, especially including important ores such as gold and
    iron are now below 1%. Natural flora have also slowly depleted due to a combination
    of resource overuse and climate change."


    >>: "Aerospace Engineer, Julia
    Sharper, who is currently leading the dyson sphere project, FRONTIER, has reported
    this resource depletion back on the home planet will make construction a bit
    more difficult. Mars mining expeditions have begun and as well extractions around
    Jupiter''s moons are now being focused to gather vital ores. Production of synthetic
    crops has also amped up and Dune CIty here on Mars is expected to have an increase
    of factories producing these crops by 60%."


    >>: "Second leading aerospace
    engineer, Carver Machaon passed away recently due to natural causes. But Julia
    Sharper has assured his mind will enter a ''Catalyst'' to continue assisting
    in the projects construction and planning."


    >>: "Now here''s Wolter Nicholos
    for your Martian weather this coming week.".....


    >>: DATA CORRUPTED. END
    OF RECOVERY.'
