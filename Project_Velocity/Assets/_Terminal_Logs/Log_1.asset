    >>: RECOVERED ARCHIVED ARTICLE FROM 20X9.


    >>
    Title: Evolution of the Mind.


    >>: "... With the success of project MINDSCAPE,
    neurologist Olivia Sharper has established what was long to be science fiction.
    Deceased minds are now capable of being stored into data as memory in a device
    named ''Catalyst'', and are able to function like an advanced A.I, with decision
    making that would require thought rather than algorithm."


    >>:''.. The ethical
    means is still to be discussed'' stated Olivia, when asked the potential criticism
    this new technology will bring.


    >>:''We don''t want it to weaponized, I
    make that clear upfront to the governments who are already starting to circle
    around this technology.''


    >>: "First mind transferred into the ''Catalyst''
    was Olivia''s husband, who worked along side her on the project. However he had
    passed away due to ailments and for a time the project was put on pause. But
    before his inevitable passing, was Olivia given permission by him to use his
    brain to finalize the test of the device."


    >>: ''It''s not totally him,
    just a fragment but enough to function as if he was a person, to exhibit the
    best traits humans can. To solve solutions as fast as a computer, but with empathy,
    sympathy, rather than pure rational thought of a computer.''....

    CORRUPTED. END OF RECOVERY.
