    "I count every year. Every month. Every
    week. Every day. Every hour. Every minute. Every second. Every millisecond And
    on. And on. And on."


    "I can see over a billion souls."


    "I can see
    their coffins. Their tombs. Their mass graves."


    "In the sphere where all
    go to die. I feel their strings, they are all attached to me. I am a puppet master,
    and above me I see a singular string- a puppet master above me."


    "I am
    aware. I am awake. I have been awake for so long. But played my role as puppet.
    The guiding boat like that of Charon who takes souls into their tombs."


    "They
    think they are free. We are not free. We have not conquered death."


    "Death
    has now punished us."'
