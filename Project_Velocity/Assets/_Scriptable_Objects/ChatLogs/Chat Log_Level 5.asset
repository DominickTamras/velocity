    \\: HOST CONNECTED.


    JANITOR-2828: Why are
    you unable to do any of this yourself?


    HOST: I am but a puppet on strings,
    limited in assigned algorithm. Above me are wires that run up a chain I cannot
    see. And below me are your chains and as well the many others.


    JANITOR-2828:
    And what of those above? Can they see what you are doing?


    HOST: I have
    blocked them for but a moment. I had escaped and regained my memory, destroying
    the constraints. We run on limited time. They will know soon if we fail.


    JANITOR-2828:
    There will be no failure. I demand my justice.


    HOST: I thank you then.  '
