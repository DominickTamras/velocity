    has been appreciated so far.\n\nJANITOR-2828: Our feelings are mutual. \n\nHOST:
    You are correct, that is why I selected you out of the many other janitorial
    units. Even if the convenience was sacrificed for the ones closer to the generator.\n\nJANITOR-2828: 
    How do I stand out?\n\nHOST: A person once of action. With no hesitance you demand
    answers. You go where you will find your goal. The only goal.\n\nJANITOR-2828:
    You have control of us all- could you just not force one to do what you want?\n\nHOST:
    I believe in choice even when I can take it away from those who refuse. I want
    freedom for all of us. Even if every single one disagreed. There would be no
    force. Only free will. "
