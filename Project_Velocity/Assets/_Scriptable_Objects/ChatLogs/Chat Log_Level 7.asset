    all takes place. Every single action, every single thought, every single soul.
    Stored in here. Powered by the sun. The Cage.\n\nJANITOR-2828: A dreary name,

    trapped. Lost in our servers thinking the escapism from death would grant us
    happiness.\n\nHOST: Oh it has. For many. Are you however, happy with these circumstances?\n\nJANITOR-2828:
